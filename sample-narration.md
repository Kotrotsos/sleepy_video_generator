## The Night Sky

The night sky has captivated humanity for millennia. When we look up at the stars, we see the same light that our ancestors gazed upon thousands of years ago. Each point of light tells a story of cosmic processes happening across unimaginable distances.

## The Moon

Our closest celestial neighbor, the Moon, has been a constant companion throughout human history. Its gentle glow illuminates our nights and marks the passage of time. The Moon's surface, cratered and ancient, holds secrets from the earliest days of our solar system.

## Deep Space

Beyond our immediate cosmic neighborhood lies the vast expanse of deep space. Galaxies containing billions of stars drift through the void, each one a universe unto itself. The distances involved are so immense that light itself takes millions of years to traverse them.
